One-sentence pitch for the token/coin Project (the “Project”): A world of social liberty and fairness

Is the token/coin a security or otherwise a regulated product or instrument under U.S. federal securities law or the laws of any other (non-U.S.) jurisdiction(s)? No, similar to Hive, Blurt is a fork of the Steem blockchain (snapshot dated 20 May 2020), since Steem and Hive have not to date been deemed securities, Blurt should not be classed as a security either.
