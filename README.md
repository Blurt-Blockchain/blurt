Blurt is a public social blockchain with a diverse and vibrant community that strictly upholds [property rights](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1236373815447506945?s=20).

The Blurt blockchain is defined as social media and builds a living, breathing, and growing social economy and communities where users are getting rewarded by curators for sharing their origin content. Blurt provides a scalable blockchain protocol for publicly accessible and immutable content, along with a fast digital currency (BLURT) which enables people to earn by using their brain (A.K.A. “Proof-of-Brain”).

## Distribution
*  Blurt contains user balances imported from Block 4352**6969** of the STEEM public blockchain, snapshotted on the 20th May 2020. 
*  Approx 15% or ~60 Million BLURT from the initial supply shall be allocated to the Blurt SocialGraph Foundation (See [@initblurt](https://blocks.blurtwallet.com/#/@initblurt) / [@socialgraph](https://blocks.blurtwallet.com/#/@socialgraph) blockchain accounts).
*  SPS DAO public fund account balance was carried over to BLURT and renamed as [@blurt.dao](https://blocks.blurtwallet.com/#/@blurt.dao). Initially the SocialGraph Foundation will steward this fund and gradually had it over to community control as the platform matures.

## Features

* A **regent account** with a controlling stake or special weighted vote has been added to Blurt. 
  * The regent account can vote on Witneses and DAO Proposals.
  * The regent account decays over a two-year period with 24 equal monthly reductions to zero, starting at a power equal to all blurt supply.
