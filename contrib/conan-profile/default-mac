# MAC!  IT BUILDS ON MAC!
# You'll need some things:
# * Make sure that you did not install Boost using homebrew.  That'll override conan's built version of Boost, and Blurt will not build.
# * IPFS:  Install it and do like `mkdir ~/.blurtd && ipfs get -o ~/.blurtd/snapshot.json QmPrwVpwe4Ya46CN9LXNnrUdWvaDLMwFetMUdpcdpjFbyu`
# * Blurt source code: `git clone https://gitlab.com/blurt/blurt`
# * Xcode:  `xcode-select --install`
# * Rosary: Three hail marys, please
# Exact guide is in doc/devs/development-environment.md
